## üìã Overview

This project is a simple JavaFX desktop application that simulates a Pizza Ordering System. It allows users to add, view, update, and delete pizza orders with a user-friendly interface. Orders are stored in a MySQL database using the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Java 21** (JDK)
- **JavaFX (OpenJFX 24)**
- **MySQL** (for persistent order storage)
- **Maven** (for dependency management)
- **VS Code** (for development and testing)

---

## ‚úÖ Features

- Add new pizza orders with customer details, pizza size, and toppings
- View all orders in a TableView
- Update existing orders
- Delete orders by selection
- Clear and user-friendly JavaFX GUI
- Real-time table refresh after each operation
- DAO pattern for clean database access
- Error handling and user feedback via alerts

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Clone or download this repository.**
2. **Set up your MySQL database:**
   - Create a database and table using the provided SQL:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE pizza_orders (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         customer_name VARCHAR(100),
         mobile_number VARCHAR(20),
         pizza_size VARCHAR(5),
         number_of_toppings INT,
         total_bill DOUBLE
     );
     ```
3. **Update your database connection details** in `PizzaOrderDAO.java`:
   ```java
   conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_db", "username", "password");
   ```
4. **Build and run the project** using VS Code or Maven.
